They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"}, {'qas': [{'question': \"Which film featured Destiny's Child's first major single?\", 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90a9', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"For which song, did Destiny's Child take home the grammy award for best R&B performance?\", 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ab', 'answers': [{'text': '\"Say My Name\"', 'answer_start': 848}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Beyonce record with for the movie \"The Best Man?\"', 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ac', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Beyonce's group changed their name to Destiny's Child in what year?\", 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9677', 'answers': [{'text': '1996', 'answer_start': 51}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?\", 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9678', 'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah', 'answer_start': 85}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Debut song, \"Killing Time\" was featured on what movie\\'s sound track?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9679', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What song won Best R&B Performance in the 43 Annual Grammy Awards?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967a', 'answers': [{'text': 'Say My Name', 'answer_start': 849}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What singer did Beyonce record a song with for the movie, \\'\\'The Best Man\"?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967b', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Where did Destiny's Child get their name from?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830f9', 'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah.', 'answer_start': 85}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Destiny's Child song, Killing Time, was included in which film's soundtrack?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fa', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black.', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What was Destiny's Child's first major song hit?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fb', 'answers': [{'text': 'No, No, No', 'answer_start': 330}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"When did Destiny's Child release their second album?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fc', 'answers': [{'text': '1999', 'answer_start': 688}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Beyoncé sing a duet with for \"The Best Man\" film?', 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fd', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}], 'context': 'The group changed their name to Destiny\\'s Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

Some commentators point to events in the two men\\'s romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d\\'Agoult\\'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt\\'s growing relationship with George Sand.'}, {'qas': [{'question': 'Who was the host of the gathering where Frédéric was introduced to George Sand?', 'id': '56cc06496d243a140015ee5a', 'answers': [{'text': \"Marie d'Agoult\", 'answer_start': 30}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What did Frédéric label the place in which he placed Maria and her mother's letters about the unlikely marriage?\", 'id': '56cc06496d243a140015ee5d', 'answers': [{'text': 'My tragedy', 'answer_start': 713}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did George Sand write to when admitting having a strong affection for Frédéric?', 'id': '56cc06496d243a140015ee5e', 'answers': [{'text': 'Grzymała', 'answer_start': 747}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What is the name of the author Chopin met at a gathering put on by Marie d'Agoult?\", 'id': '56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8b', 'answers': [{'text': 'George Sand', 'answer_start': 75}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What was a possible reason for Chopin's failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska?\", 'id': '56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8e', 'answers': [{'text': 'his poor health', 'answer_start': 503}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What did Chopin write on the box of letters from Maria and her mother?', 'id': '56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8f', 'answers': [{'text': 'My tragedy', 'answer_start': 713}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who hosted the party whre Chopin met George Sand?', 'id': '56d3234159d6e41400146288', 'answers': [{'text': \"Marie d'Agoult\", 'answer_start': 30}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What year did Maria Wodzińska's mother tell Chopin that he likely would not marry her daughter?\", 'id': '56d3234159d6e41400146289', 'answers': [{'text': '1837', 'answer_start': 327}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What did Chopin write on the package that contained letters from Maria and her mother?', 'id': '56d3234159d6e4140014628b', 'answers': [{'text': 'My tragedy', 'answer_start': 713}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Sand confide to in a letter about her feelings for Chopin in June, 1838?', 'id': '56d3234159d6e4140014628c', 'answers': [{'text': 'Grzymała', 'answer_start': 747}], 'is_impossible': False}], 'context': 'In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d\\'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).

The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama\\'s mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for \"cursing\" him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama\\'s diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new Ü-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595–1657), the Dalai Lama\\'s chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the Ü-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the Ü-Tsang king\\'s troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled.

Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \"supreme authority\" as Goldstein writes, the title of \\'King of Tibet\\' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.

Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own.

Miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the game's presentation, suggested the team's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations.
